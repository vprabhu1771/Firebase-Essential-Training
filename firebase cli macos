Built flutterfire_cli:flutterfire.
Installed executable flutterfire.
Warning: Pub installs executables into $HOME/.pub-cache/bin, which is not on your path.
You can fix that by adding this to your shell's config file (.zshrc, .bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.):

export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"


To set up the Firebase CLI on macOS and activate the `flutterfire_cli` for your Flutter projects, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Firebase CLI
1. **Install Firebase CLI via npm**:
   - First, install `node` and `npm` if they are not already installed on your Mac.
     - You can install them via Homebrew:

       ```bash
       brew install node
       ```

   - After that, install the Firebase CLI globally:

     ```bash
     npm install -g firebase-tools
     ```

2. **Login to Firebase**:
   - Once installed, log in to your Firebase account:

     ```bash
     firebase login
     ```

### Step 2: Install `flutterfire_cli`
1. **Activate `flutterfire_cli`**:
   - Use the `dart` command to activate the `flutterfire_cli` globally:

     ```bash
     dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
     ```

2. **Set PATH for Dart CLI**:
   - To make the `flutterfire` command available globally, you'll need to add the path to the Dart CLI tools. First, find the directory where Dart global packages are installed. Usually, it's in `$HOME/.pub-cache/bin`.

   - Open your terminal and edit your `.zshrc` (for zsh) or `.bash_profile` (for bash) file to include the path:

     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```

     Add the following line to the file:

     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
     ```

   - Save the file (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`), and reload the terminal configuration:

     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Verify that `flutterfire` is correctly installed by running:

     ```bash
     flutterfire --version
     ```

### Step 3: Use `flutterfire_cli` to Configure Firebase
1. **Configure Firebase for Flutter**:
   - In your Flutter project directory, run the following command to configure Firebase:

     ```bash
     flutterfire configure
     ```

That's it! You should now have Firebase CLI and `flutterfire_cli` set up on your Mac.
